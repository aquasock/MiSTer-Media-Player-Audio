# Architecture

MiSTer Media Player is being developed as a standards-driven media decoder for MiSTer, with MPEG-2 Video decoding performed primarily in FPGA logic.

## High-level partitioning

### HPS / host side

The host currently supplies media bytes through the existing MiSTer data path. Longer-term host responsibilities are expected to include filesystem access, buffering, program-stream demux, timestamp/control handling, audio coordination, and DVD/optical-drive integration.

### FPGA side

The active FPGA pipeline performs:

1. asynchronous input buffering and clock-domain crossing;
2. H.262 byte/bit reading with backpressure;
3. picture/slice/macroblock/block parsing;
4. MPEG-2 DCT VLC decoding;
5. inverse quantization;
6. fixed-point two-pass 8x8 IDCT;
7. intra reconstruction;
8. planar Y/Cb/Cr frame storage in DDR3;
9. DDR3 readback through small ping-pong line caches;
10. 4:2:0 chroma expansion;
11. limited-range BT.601 YCbCr-to-RGB conversion;
12. fixed diagnostic video timing and MiSTer presentation.

## Active decoder

The clean decoder lives in `rtl/mpeg2_new/` and is the only MPEG-2 decoder implementation included in the active `files.qip` source list.

The older `rtl/mpeg2fpga/` implementation is retained only as a frozen reference. It is not part of the active design.

## Current supported implementation path

The present hardware-proven diagnostic path covers consecutive progressive 4:2:0 I frame pictures up to the current 720x480 diagnostic geometry.

Picture 1 is fully decoded, reconstructed, written to DDR3, read back, and displayed. The same parser is then locally re-armed and reused for picture 2, which is proven through reconstruction but is not yet stored or displayed.

These limits describe the current implementation only. They are not restrictions imposed by H.262.

## DDR frame layout

The current framebuffer format is planar 8-bit Y, Cb, and Cr.

For the maximum current diagnostic geometry:

- Y: 720x480;
- Cb: 360x240;
- Cr: 360x240;
- eight adjacent 8-bit pixels are packed into one 64-bit DDR word;
- Y stride: 90 DDR words per row;
- Cb/Cr stride: 45 DDR words per row.

The current frame resides in a DDR region beginning at physical byte address `0x30000000`. This region was chosen after an earlier base at `0x20000000` collided with MiSTer's system-video/scaler use of DDR.

## Presentation path

Full-frame storage is kept in DDR3 rather than M10K memory. The display side uses small dual-clock ping-pong caches:

- two 720-pixel Y lines;
- two 360-pixel Cb lines;
- two 360-pixel Cr lines.

This architecture reduced on-chip memory pressure dramatically and restored full 8-bit chroma storage/presentation.

Chroma expansion is currently nearest-neighbor 4:2:0 replication. This is sufficient for decoder validation but is known to produce visible color fringing on fine anti-aliased text. Better chroma positioning/interpolation is planned as a presentation-quality improvement.

## Clocking and CDC

The principal active clocks are:

- 54 MHz decoder/memory-side logic;
- 40 MHz diagnostic video timing.

Phase 1P established the project's current timing/CDC discipline:

- true same-clock datapaths must meet timing without broad exceptions;
- reset assertion may remain asynchronous where required;
- reset release is synchronized independently in each destination domain;
- DCFIFO asynchronous-clear synchronization is enabled;
- CDC/reset exceptions are narrowly scoped to intentional synchronizer boundaries.

After meaningful architectural changes, run:

```bash
quartus_sta -t tools/phase1p_timing.tcl
```

## Successive-picture architecture

The decoder currently uses one hardware-proven parser for consecutive pictures.

After picture 1 completes, the wrapper:

1. latches picture-1 diagnostics;
2. applies a local parser re-arm/reset cycle;
3. allows the same parser to locate and decode picture 2;
4. changes the downstream completion handshake so picture 2 can advance after reconstruction rather than DDR persistence.

The next phase will replace this diagnostic-only second-picture path with alternate-bank DDR storage and a controlled display-frame swap.

## Standards boundary

H.262 / ISO/IEC 13818-2 is the normative source for MPEG-2 Video syntax and decoding behavior. H.222.0 / ISO/IEC 13818-1 is the normative source for MPEG systems/program-stream behavior.

Temporary buffer sizes, supported geometries, diagnostic formats, presentation filters, and development-stage picture-type limits are implementation decisions and should not be presented as standard requirements.
